# Schematic and Boards
I use KiCad with the help of plugins to make it easier to have multi board stack modules.
## My workflow
Based on this workflow you would understand better the files that are in this folder.
- Create an initial schematic
- Create a multiboard schematic
- Design the boards in one file
- Separate the boards using the KiKit plugin
- Use the PCBWay plugin to automatically send the gerbers for PCB manufacturing
